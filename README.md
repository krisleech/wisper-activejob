## Installation

```ruby
gem 'wisper-activejob'
```

## Usage

```ruby
publisher.subscribe(MyListener, async: true)
```

The listener must be a class (or module), not an object. This is because ActiveJob
can not reconstruct the state of an object. Whereas a class has no state.

Additionally, you should also ensure that your methods used to handle events under `MyListener` are all declared as class methods:

```ruby
class MyListener
  def self.event_name(arg1, arg2)
  end
end
```

If you prefer to have a job class for each event listener, have your listener extend from `ActiveJob::Base`, include
`Wisper::ActiveJob::Listener` in it, and Wisper will automatically use this job instead of its own internal
wrapper job:

```ruby
class MyImportantListener < ApplicationJob
  include Wisper::ActiveJob::Listener

  queues_as :high_priority

  def self.event_name(arg1, arg2)
  end
end
```

This can help with observability and prioritisation, since you can give different listeners different priorities, and
they can be distinguished in APM software with ActiveJob integrations such as Datadog.

When publishing events the arguments must be simple types as they need to be
serialized, or the object must include `GlobalID` such as `ActiveRecord` models.
