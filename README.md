## Installation

```ruby
gem 'wisper-activejob'
```

## Usage

```ruby
publisher.subscribe(MyListener, async: true)
```

The listener must be a class (or module), not an object. This is because ActiveJob
can not reconstruct the state of an object. Whereas a class has no state.

Additionally, you should also ensure that your methods used to handle events under `MyListener` are all declared as class methods:

```ruby
class MyListener
  def self.event_name
  end
end
```

### Running subscriber in a specific queue

All jobs are by default enqueued in the `default` queue. You can however specify for a listener which queue to use by implementing a `queue` class method:

```ruby
class MyListener
  def self.queue
    :fast
  end

  def self.event_name
  end
end
```

When publishing events the arguments must be simple types as they need to be
serialized, or the object must include `GlobalID` such as `ActiveRecord` models.
